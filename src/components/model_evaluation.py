model_evaluation.py

This module is part of the 'src/components' package and is used for evaluating machine learning models. 
It contains functions and classes that help in assessing the performance of trained models using various metrics and techniques. 
The evaluation results can be used to fine-tune models, compare different models, and ensure that the models meet the desired performance criteria.
