This module contains the ModelTrainer class, which is responsible for training machine learning models.

Classes:
    ModelTrainer: A class that encapsulates the logic for training machine learning models, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Methods:
    __init__(self, model, data): Initializes the ModelTrainer with a specific model and dataset.
    preprocess_data(self): Preprocesses the data before training.
    train_model(self): Trains the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
    evaluate_model(self): Evaluates the trained model on a validation dataset.
    save_model(self, filepath): Saves the trained model to a specified file path.
