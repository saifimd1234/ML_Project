# The purpose of the train_pipeline in the src/components is to orchestrate the entire training process of the machine learning model.
# This typically includes:
# 1. Data Loading: Reading and preprocessing the data from various sources.
# 2. Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into features that can be used by the machine learning model.
# 3. Model Training: Training the machine learning model using the prepared data.
# 4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using validation data.
# 5. Model Saving: Saving the trained model to disk for later use.
# 6. Logging: Logging important information and metrics throughout the training process for monitoring and debugging purposes.
