This module defines custom exception classes for the machine learning project.
These exceptions are used to handle specific error cases and provide more
informative error messages throughout the project.

Classes:
    CustomException: A base class for other custom exceptions.
    DataValidationError: Raised when data validation fails.
    ModelTrainingError: Raised when an error occurs during model training.
    PredictionError: Raised when an error occurs during prediction.

Usage:
    Use these custom exceptions to handle and raise specific errors in your
    machine learning pipeline, ensuring that error handling is consistent and
    informative.
